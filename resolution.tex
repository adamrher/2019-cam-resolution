\section{Introduction}

An increasing number of Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs) are being developed to maximize efficiency on massively parallel systems, permitting regionally-refined high-resolution, or even globally high-resolution weather ($\Delta x = 5$ km and less) and climate ($\Delta x = 50$ km and less) simulations \citep{MPASatm,Z2014QJRMS,HETAL2016JCLIM,DCMIP16,LetAl2018JAMES}. These models are built using unstructured meshes that while allow for substantial grid flexibility, require physical parameterizations ({\em{physics}}) that behave consistently as the truncation scale of the model changes with different grid resolutions, referred to as scale-aware physics. The most common approach towards developing scale-aware physics is through the lens of limited area, large-eddy simulations \citep[e.g.,][]{PC2008JAS,AW2013JAS,SZ2018JCLIM}. Through subsequently filtering large-eddy solutions to lower-resolution grids, a relationship between first- and higher-order moments \citep{G1992JFM} may be understood and ultimately parameterized as a function of grid resolution. While this approach is likely necessary for developing scale-aware physics, it is not sufficient. The equations of motions have inherent scale dependencies, and the properties of dynamical modes also vary with native grid resolution \citep{O1981JAS,WETAL1997MWR,PG2006JAS,JR2016QJRMS,J2017JAMES}. Scale-aware physics should also recognize these native grid dependencies.

The sensitivity of the Community Atmosphere Model \citep[CAM;][]{CAM5}, and its predecessor, the Community Climate Model (CCM) to resolution ({\em{resolution}} refers to {\em{horizontal resolution}}, hereafter) is well documented through convergence studies \citep{KW1991JGR,WETAL1995CD,W2008TELLUS,RETAL2013JCLIM,ZetAl2014JCb,HR2017JCLIM}. Despite thirty years of continual model development, there are robust sensitivities to resolution that have persisted in all versions of the model. This study argues that a unifying cause, the inherent scale sensitivities of the underlying dynamical equations, can explain the robust responses to resolution that occur in CAM/CCM, {\color{red}{since it is difficult to conceive that inevitable responses to native grid resolution could be ignored in the pursuit of scale-aware physics.}}

In CAM/CCM, the atmosphere progressively dries with increasing resolution, seen through a reduction in simulated total precipitable water \citep{KW1991JGR,WETAL1995CD,W2008TELLUS,RETAL2013JCLIM,ZetAl2014JCb,HR2017JCLIM}, which typically, but not always \citep[see][]{WETAL1995CD,ZetAl2014JCb}, coincides with a reduction in cloud cover. \cite{KW1991JGR} and \cite{WETAL1995CD} suggested that the drying of the atmosphere is due to greater magnitude resolved vertical velocities with increasing resolution, with greater subsiding motion increasing the export of dry air from the upper troposphere. This mechanism is consistent with an analysis of moisture budgets in CAM, version 4 \citep[CAM4;][]{CAM4} across multiple resolutions \citep{YETAL2014JCLIM,HR2017JCLIM}.

It is well known that the magnitude of vertical velocities increase with resolution in atmospheric models. While the cause of this sensitivity has been established for large-eddy simulations \citep[see][and references therein]{J2017JAMES}, only recently has the vertical velocity field in AGCMs and their sensitivity to resolution received attention \citep{DETALA2016ACP,OETAL2016JAMES}, albeit with conflicting explanations \citep{RETAL2016CD,HR2018JAMES}. To generalize the relationship between vertical velocity and resolution, let $\alpha$ refer to the ratio of $W_0$, the vertical velocity scale of some reference grid spacing $\Delta x_0$, to $W$, the vertical velocity scale of any $\Delta x$. A power law for $\alpha$ in $\Delta x$ is then,
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{W_0}{W} = \left( \frac{\Delta x_0}{\Delta x} \right)^n, \label{eq:alpha}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the power law exponent. 

\cite{RETAL2016CD} derive an estimate $n= b-1$ by combining a scale analysis of the continuity equation with a power law representation $\Delta x^{2b}$ of the second-order structure function of the horizontal wind. Strictly speaking, $\Delta x$ here refers to the distance between two points for which the velocity increment is computed in the structure function, but with this distance set to the model grid-spacing. Observations indicate that $b=\frac{1}{3}$ for scales less than about $1000$ km \citep{CETAL1999JGR}, which according to the Weinerâ€“Khinchin theorem $- \left( 2b+1 \right) = -\frac{5}{3}$ is equal to the slope of the kinetic energy spectrum for mesoscale motions \citep{NG1985JAS}. \cite{RETAL2016CD} argue that the $-\frac{5}{3}$ slope is common in both observations and models, and provides an emergent constraint for $n= -\frac{2}{3}$.

In large-eddy simulations, the sensitivity of vertical velocities to resolution is adequately explained by a scale analysis of the dynamical equations \citep{WETAL1997MWR,PG2006JAS,JR2016QJRMS}. For hydrostatic scales relevant to AGCMs, a scale analysis of the Poisson equation gives $W \propto D^{-1}$, where $D$ is the horizontal scale of a buoyancy perturbation driving vertical motion \citep{HR2018JAMES}. In CAM aqua-planet simulations, the largest source of buoyancy is from grid-scale cloud formation, whose horizontal extents are set by the effective resolution of the model (i.e., some multiple of $\Delta x$), indicating $n=-1$ \citep{HR2018JAMES}. \cite{HR2017JCLIM} has shown that the $n=-1$ scaling does not explain the behavior of CAM4 in a convergence experiment, but follow-up studies \citep{HR2018JAMES,HETAL2019JAMES} indicate that the inadequacy of the $n=-1$ scaling is not definitive due to time-truncation errors associated with fixing the physics time-step ($\Delta t_{phys}$) across resolutions in that study.

Another robust response of the CAM/CCM lineage to resolution is an increase in stratiform precipitation rates (i.e., the precipitation from grid-scale clouds), at the expense of parameterized convective precipitation rates. This behavior is summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:cam-history}, which is a bar-graph of the climatological, global mean stratiform and convective precipitation rates in prior CAM/CCM convergence studies. The studies of \cite{KW1991JGR}, \cite{WETAL1995CD} and \cite{W2013QJRMS} indicate that the tendency to reduce $\Delta t_{phys}$ with resolution would by itself reduce the convective precipitation rates, however Figure~\ref{fig:cam-history} (top row) indicates that convergence studies with fixed $\Delta t_{phys}$ still show a reduction in convective precipitation rates with resolution.

Studies included in this figure are \cite{KW1991JGR} (CCM1), \cite{WETAL1995CD} (CCM2), \cite{W2008TELLUS} (CAM3), \cite{RETAL2013JCLIM,ZetAl2014JCb,HR2017JCLIM} (CAM4), \cite{ZetAl2014JCb} (CAM5) and this study (CAM6). CCM2* refers to the modified parameter experiment of \cite{WETAL1995CD}, where parameters vary with resolution to reduce the dependence of cloud fraction on resolution.}

In this study, a typical convergence experiment using CAM, version 6 (CAM6; \url{https://ncar.github.io/CAM/doc/build/html/users_guide/index.html}) is carried out and analyzed in detail. It is shown that the resolution sensitivity of vertical velocities are well described with $n=-1$ in equation~\eqref{eq:alpha}, provided $\Delta t_{phys}$ is defined in a way to avoid large truncation errors across resolutions. The reduction in convective precipitation rates with resolution in CAM6 is shown to result from the greater magnitude subsiding motion, creating a more stable atmosphere in which the criterion for parameterized convection occurs less often. The feedback of the resolved vertical motion on the physics indicates that the root cause of resolution sensitivity in CAM arises from the sensitivity of resolved dynamical modes to native grid resolution. Section 2 describes CAM6 and details the convergence experiment. Section 3 contains a thorough analysis of the CAM6 simulations and Section 4 provides some discussion and conclusions.
